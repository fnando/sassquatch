# Sassquatch

Some SCSS mixins I've written/collected since I started using it.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem "sassquatch"

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sassquatch

On your `app/stylesheets/application.css`:

    require sassquatch

### Using outside Rails

You can install the Sassquatch files for using without Rails:

    $ sassquatch install
